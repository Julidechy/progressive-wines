                <p class="text-white">Dharma Vagabonds mÃ¡s que una agrupaciÃ³n o proyecto musical es un espacio en el que la experimentaciÃ³n formal, la apertura instrumental, la fusiÃ³n estilÃ­stica, la exploraciÃ³n tecnolÃ³gica y la interpretaciÃ³n en vivo, definen un concepto sonoro vasto y en constante desarrollo.</p>
                <p class="text-white">GÃ©neros de la MÃºsica ElectrÃ³nica tales como Trip Hop, Downtempo, I.D.M., Glitch, elementos de la MÃºsica Orquestal y conceptos compositivos como el Minimalismo o la canciÃ³n, confluyen en una propuesta musical que combina instrumentaciÃ³n acÃºstica con sonidos electrÃ³nicos y diversas tecnologÃ­as de vanguardia .</p>
                <p class="text-white">Los conciertos de Dharma Vagabonds presentan una formaciÃ³n diferente en cada ocasiÃ³n, lo que da lugar a infinitas propuestas y conceptos musicales. Dichos conciertos tienen a Max Donato como Ãºnico integrante estable y compositor responsable del proyecto, interpretando en vivo sintetizadores, Guitarra Midi, Bajo y Programaciones. La riqueza sonora y estÃ©tica de los shows es producto de la larga y diversa lista de mÃºsicos invitados, entre ellos, cantantes, pianistas, bajistas, bateristas, violinistas.</p>

                <p class="text-white">Ha participado en fiestas importantes en el cono sur y siempre dejando su particular sello en cada actuaciÃ³n.</p>
                <p class="text-white">Sus aires de techno reflejan un estilo musical fundamentalmente instrumental, con escasa presencia de vocales. Pone el Ã©nfasis en la secciÃ³n rÃ­tmica, tanto por ser mÃºsica de baile como por su inserciÃ³n dentro de la sesiÃ³n del DJ, la utilizaciÃ³n de timbres musicales sintÃ©ticos es tambiÃ©n muy relevante.</p>
